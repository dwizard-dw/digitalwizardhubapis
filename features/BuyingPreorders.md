# Buying pre-orders

### Requirements

1. The `keyType` field is not allowed with pre-order.
2. You can order only one pre-order per request.
3. Buying pre-order with regular products is not allowed.

### How to download the keys for pre-order

The keys will be delivered after their release date. 
If you have configured the `order.status` webhook, then you will receive the notification with the `completed` status, which means that keys have been delivered.
