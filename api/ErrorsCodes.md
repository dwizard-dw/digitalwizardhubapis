# Errors codes

In case of error API returns HTTP status code different from `2xx` and JSON object in below format:

```json
{
    "kind": "ConstraintViolation",
    "status": 400,
    "title": "Bad Request",
    "detail": "Invalid \"products\" property. Sum of total values of \"qty\" must be lower than or equal 90.",
    "path": "/api/v1/order",
    "method": "POST",
    "trace": "082a4cee9b",
    "timestamp": "2020-09-01T13:06:06+00:00",
    "propertyPath": "products",
    "invalidValue": 100
}
```

The fields such as: `kind`, `status`, `title`, `detail`, `path`, `method`, `trace` and `timestamps` should be always presented.

The rest of the fields are intended to present the context of the problem. Each of error kind have an own set of custom fields.

> Check `detail` property for more info about the problem.
